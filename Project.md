# RCS 18 - Assessing reproducibility

## Evaluation
* **Automation**: Can all figures/calculations that are important for the inference leading to the result be reproduced in a single button press? What is required as set-up steps to the calculations in these scripts?
* **Availability of data**: Are the data available through an openly accessible database? Long-term reliability of the web address? DOI? Are the data shared in a commonly used and well-documented file format?
* **Availability of software**: Source code available for inspection? Documentation of dependencies.
* **Software documentation**: README, narrative documentation, usage examples?
* **Software engineering**: Automated testing, continuous integration, versioning scheme
* **Licensing/Copyright**: Is the data and the code released under a license? Is the license permissive enough to build on top of the work?
* **Open reporting**:  Open access publication (green/gold access)
